    @template block_xp/rules-page-loading-success

    Placeholder to identify that the rules loaded properly. This adds a bit of
    JavaScript to remove the loading error, just so we guarantee that it will
    never be displayed if this code executes. Although the error itself does try
    to prevent displaying itself it this has been printed.

    It's best we do not use the #js tag here because that may conflict.

    Example context (json):
    {
    }
}}
<div id="block_xp_rules_page_loading_success" style="display: none">
    <script>
        (function() {
            try {
                var elerror = document.getElementById('block_xp_rules_page_loading_error');
                elerror && elerror.remove && elerror.remove();
            } catch (err) {
                console.log(err);
            }
        })();
    </script>
</div>
