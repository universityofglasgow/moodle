# moodle-local_annoto
Annoto is an in-video collaboration solution that turns static, 1-way video Stream/VOD into an active group learning experience, where participants contribute, share and learn together. Users can lean forward and become participants and not just passive and lonely viewers, causing all users to be actively involved and return to the video content, sharing more ideas and creating more meaningful content. Resulting in higher engagement and retention, supported by comprehensive analytics and insights, that facilitate dramatic improvements to content, communications, and measurable outcomes. Annoto local plugin will identify videos at the content of the activities and will add annoto to matched video based on plugin settings.
