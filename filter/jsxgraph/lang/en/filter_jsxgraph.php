 * This is a plugin to enable function plotting and dynamic geometry constructions with JSXGraph within a Moodle platform.
 *
 * JSXGraph is a cross-browser JavaScript library for interactive geometry,
 * function plotting, charting, and data visualization in the web browser.
 * JSXGraph is implemented in pure JavaScript and does not rely on any other
 * library. Special care has been taken to optimize the performance.
