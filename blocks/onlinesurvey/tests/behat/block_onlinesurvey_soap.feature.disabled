Feature: Using the onlinesurvey block with the evasys SOAP API
  In order to provide access to our evasys online surveys
  As admin
  I want to configure the block_onlinesurvey plugin to connect to evasys via SOAP and want to add the block to the Dashboard

# This behat test feature file is fully working.
# But it needs a working evasys backend with surveys and users set up in a way as this test expects them as well.
# Because of that, the feature file is currently only shipped as disabled skeleton.
