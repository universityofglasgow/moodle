# Flexible sections course format for Moodle

In this course format:

- sections can be added inside other sections
- each section (regardless of its nesting level) can be shown either on the same page as parent or on a separate page.
  Teacher can change it in edit mode.
- If section is displayed on a separate page, it's name is displayed as a link and on this  page the link "Back to ... "
  is displayed
- If teacher hides a section all nested sections and activities become hidden as well.

Please note that if section has both activities and subsections activities are displayed first.
