Installation Instructions
=========================

This is the block element of the Moodle direct version 2 package, which contains 3 elements for each respective plugin on Moodle. Each plugin requires that you are using Moodle 2.3 or higher. Before installing these plugins firstly make sure you are logged in as an Administrator.

Note: the turnitintooltwo module must be installed before you can use this turnitin block.

This block plugin enables non-administrator moodle users to migrate courses from Turnitin to Moodle. To install, all you need to do is copy the /blocks/turnitin directory from the zip file in to your Moodle installations /blocks directory. You should then go to "Site Administration" > "Notifications" and follow the on screen instructions. 

Once the block is installed, it will need to be added to one or more of your Moodle screens. To do this you should switch Moodle to editing mode, in Moodle 2.5 this is done by clicking the "Turn editing on" button. Once the "Add a block" box is showing on screen select "Turnitin" and the block will be added to the screen. The block can be dragged around and positioned wherever you require.

If you have added a block and the logged-in user is enrolled on a class within your Turnitin account then a link will be displayed detailing how many classes a user has available to migrate. If the user has no courses available to migrate then the block will be hidden.
