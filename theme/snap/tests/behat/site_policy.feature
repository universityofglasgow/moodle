@theme @theme_snap
Feature: As an authenticated non-admin user, opening the snap personal menu redirects to the site policy acceptance
  page when not previously accepted.

  Background:
    Given the following config values are set as admin:
      | defaulthomepage | 0                           |
      | sitepolicy      | http://somesitepolicy.local |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Opening personal menu redirects to site policy page appropriately when personal menu set to show on login.

    And I have been redirected to the site policy page

    And I log out
    When I log in as "student1"
    Then I am currently on the default site home page
