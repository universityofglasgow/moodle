Installation
------------

Before installing this plugin firstly make sure you are logged in as an Administrator and that you are using Moodle 2.3 or higher.

Note: the [TURNITINTOOLTWO](https://github.com/turnitin/moodle-mod_turnitintooltwo) module must be installed before you can use the plagiarism plugin.

The Plagiarism Plugin can be used within the following Moodle modules:

- Assignments
- Forums
- Workshops

To install, you need to copy all the files into the plagiarism/turnitin directory in your Moodle installation. You should then go to `"Site Administration" > "Notifications"` where you should follow the on screen instructions.

Plagiarism plugins also need to be enabled before this plugin can be used. You can do this by going to `"Site Administration" > "Advanced Features"` and ticking the "Enable plagiarism plugins" box before saving.

The Plagiarism Plugin will inherit connection settings from the turnitintooltwo module, but you can set default values and whether the plugin is enabled within Moodle modules by going to `"Site Administration" > "Plugins" > "Plagiarism prevention" > "Turnitin plagiarism plugin"`.

To create/update assignments, process submissions and update grades your moodle environment will need to have cron job running regularly. For information on how to do this please consult http://docs.moodle.org/26/en/Cron.

Note that this plugin inherits it's Turnitin connection from the turnitintooltwo module.
