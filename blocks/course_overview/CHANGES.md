## 3.3.1 ##

* Debugging messages raised by using deprecated `print_overview()` are not
  displayed now (the better fix would be to actually remove these calls, but it
  has to wait for the new maintainer).

## 3.3.0 ##

* Initial release of this block as a standalone plugin after being removed from
  Moodle core.
