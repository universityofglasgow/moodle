# STACK API

STACK also has an API to provide STACK questions as a web service.

The API provides a basic, stateless, interface to STACK questions.  This is an advanced feature.  STACK is shipped with a very basic front-end for evaluation and testing, but the use of the API will require existing questions in Moodle XML, a "quiz system" to manage access to individual questions, and a database to store attempts at questions.

The code, and further documentation, for the API is in the `api/README.md` directory of the distribution.
