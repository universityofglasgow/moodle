Game module for Moodle
===============================================================================
Created by: Vasilis Daloukas (bdaloukas)


Many ideas and code were taken from other Moodle modules and Moodle itself


This module gets input from quiz, glossary or questions and plays some games. The games are:


* hangman
* crossword
* cryptex
* millionaire
* sudoku
* Snakes and Ladders
* The hidden picture
* Book with questions

If you like the Game activity module please consider donating at https://www.paypal.me/moodlegame to help me have more time to continue working on this project. This module is and will remain free, but your donation allows me to continue the development, and any amount is greatly appreciated.
