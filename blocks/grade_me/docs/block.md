This block is added within the context of a site or course to display gradeable items, which appear as a tree that expands to show individual grade submissions with corresponding hyperlinks.  Individual gradeable items can be opened and graded from within the block, and when all pending items within the given context have been graded a message displays in the block indicating "Nothing to grade!"
