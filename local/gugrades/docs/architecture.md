# Introduction and Goals



## Requirements Overview 

This describes the requirements for the staff-facing side of the new GCAT development.

## General description

The code is organised as a conventional Moodle 'local' plugin. The facilities in lib.php are used to tie the plugin into the Moodle navigation. It appears in the 'More..' tab/menu of each Moodle course. This link maps to the index.php file which is located in the ui/dist folder (more about this later) with a single parameter - the course id. 

The user interface is coded in ['Vue.js'](https://vuejs.org/), in particular it utlises the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) 'Vue standard tooling'.  See the [vue.md](vue.md) file for more details. 

The index.php file is quite simple. It contains the usual Moodle boilerplate - header, footer, login and capability checks, and so on. It loads a number of javascript libraries - these consist of both a Moodle AMD module defined in the plugin and the javascript generated by the Vue tooling. The actual page content contains only a div which will be controlled by Vue. 

As Vue runs entirely client-side, its interaction with Moodle is via web services. Normal Moodle web service calls are used. Each custom web service is given its own class in 'classes/external'. Most of the non-UI processing originates with these web services. 

The classes/ directory also contains a number of classes that contain static shared functions. These functions should be comprehensively commented. 

# Organisation of code

* The plugin is written as a Moodle "local plugin". See https://moodledev.io/docs/apis/plugintypes/local
* The basic organisation is to code the user interface in Javascript and the "business logic" in PHP.
* The user interface is primarily developed using the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) javascript library and tooling
* The user interface access the backend using web services. This leverages Moodle's standard web service library. See https://moodledev.io/docs/apis/subsystems/external
* Some 'glue logic' is coded as a Moodle AMD module to allow the Vue code to access Moodle's javascript modules (e.g. strings, ajax, notifications).
