# Vue.js

The [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) Javascript framework has been used to implement the user interface of the project. In particular the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) standard tooling for Vue is used to structure and build the project. 

The Vue portion lives entirely within the 'ui/' subdirectory. 

Note that Vue requires a build step to create its final code. This is normally done using a built-in node-based web server but as we are already servicing Moodle this has been done slightly differently.
