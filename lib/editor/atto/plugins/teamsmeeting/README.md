**NOTICE:** Meeting options are only available for meetings that were created with Atto plugin v1.2 and later.

## Localization (available with Atto plugin v1.2 and later)
Atto Teams Meeting plugin also enables to use Meetings App locale feature. User language selected in Moodle is passed to Meetings App. At the moment Meetings app supported locales - 'ar', 'bg', 'cs', 'cy', 'da', 'de', 'en-us', 'en-gb', 'es', 'es-mx', 'fi', 'fr', 'fr-ca', 'he', 'is', 'it', 'ja', 'ko', 'nb', 'nl', 'no', 'nn-no', 'pl', 'pt-br', 'pt-pt', 'ru', 'sv', 'th', 'tr', 'zh-cn', 'zh-tw'.

Atto Teams Meeting plugin itself by default supports only 'en' locale. However, Moodle community is adding more translations for the plugin. [Full list can be found here](https://moodle.org/plugins/translations.php?plugin=atto_teamsmeeting).

You can allways add translations yourself. [More details here](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Translating_plugins).
