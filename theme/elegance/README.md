The "Elegance" Moodle Theme
======================

The idea of this theme, as usual with my themes, is to make the site look as little like Moodle as possible. In this specific instance, it would be used on sites where Moodle would potentially serve as a company homepage rather than just a course list.

Cool things to know about the theme.
 - It is a 2 column theme. (please don't ask for it to be made into 3)
 - It is built upon the Bootstrap 3 framework
 - It provides a dropdown menu for users with links set by the admin
 - The slider on the frontpage of the site is completely customisable through theme settings
 - The Theme uses [Google web fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/) to give it that extra bit of shazam!
 - It is HIGHLY customisable with colors and images
 - Has a page loading indicator built into the header
 - Has a gorgeous new Login screen with background slideshow options
 - It changes course display by using "resource tiles" rather than links
 - If using the "one section per page" option it provides a cleaner navigation in the footer
 - The theme has a customised MyMoodle page to look more visually appealing.
 - The frontpage consists of spaces to create quick links and Marketing info all set through theme settings
 - Social Network icons appear at the footer of the page dynamically based on theme settings
 - Videos are resized dynamically to fit available screen space. A max-width can be set in the settings if needed.
