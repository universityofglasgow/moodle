## What it is
The filedownloader plugin lets you download files attached to questions within a quiz.
The plugin lets you choose which questiontypes will be included in the download. 
Also it will create a textfile that cointains user and meta information for each downloaded file.

## Preferences

(*) if anonymization is disabled.

With anonymization enabled, names and e-mail adresses will also be cut from the output folder names.
