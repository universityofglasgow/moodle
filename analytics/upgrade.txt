This files describes API changes in analytics sub system,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.7 ===

* \core_analytics\regressor::evaluate_regression and \core_analytics\classifier::evaluate_classification
  have been updated to include a new $trainedmodeldir param. This new param will be used to evaluate the
  existing trained model.
* Plugins and core subsystems can now declare default prediction models by describing them in
  their db/analytics.php file. Models should not be created manually via the db/install.php
  file any more.
* The method \core_analytics\manager::add_builtin_models() has been deprecated. The functionality
  has been replaced with automatic update of models provided by the core moodle component. There
  is no need to call this method explicitly any more. Instead, adding new models can be achieved
  by updating the lib/db/analytics.php file and bumping the core version.

=== 3.5 ===

* There are two new methods for analysers, processes_user_data() and join_sample_user(). You
  need to overwrite them if your analyser uses user data. As a general statement, you should
  overwrite these new methods if your samples return 'user' data. These new methods are used
  for analytics' privacy API implementation.
