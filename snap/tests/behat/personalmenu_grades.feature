@theme @theme_snap @_bug_phantomjs
Feature: When the moodle theme is set to Snap, students and teachers can open a personal menu which shows a
  grades / grading column showing them things that have recently had feedback or have recently been submitted.

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 | 1 |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1 | student |

  @javascript
  Scenario: No assignments submitted or graded.
    Given the following "activities" exist:
      | activity | course | idnumber | name                 | intro                       | assignsubmission_onlinetext_enabled |
      | assign   | C1     | assign1  | Test assignment1 | Test assignment description 1 | 1 |
      | assign   | C1     | assign2  | Test assignment2 | Test assignment description 2 | 1 |
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I open the personal menu
   Then I should see "You have no submissions to grade."
    And I follow "Log out"
    And I log in as "student1"
    And I open the personal menu
    And I should see "You have no recent feedback."
    And I should see "Feedback"

  @javascript
  Scenario: 1 out of 2 assignments are submitted by student and graded by teacher.
    Given the following "activities" exist:
      | activity | course | idnumber | name                 | intro                       | assignsubmission_onlinetext_enabled | assignfeedback_comments_enabled | section |
      | assign   | C1     | assign1  | Test assignment1 | Test assignment description 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
      | assign   | C1     | assign2  | Test assignment2 | Test assignment description 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

    And I log in as "student1"
    And I open the personal menu
    And I should see "Feedback"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Topic 1"
    And I wait until "#section-1" "css_element" is visible
    And I should see "Test assignment1"

    # Note - we can not follow assignments or anything that is searchable using the course quick search tool.
    # This is because everything that is searchable lives as a hidden link towards to the top of the DOM.
    # Hidden links break "I follow" instructions for visible links with the same text further down the DOM.
    # Swapped "Test assignment1" follow for "Not Submitted" which is less specific but achieves the same
    # https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-51669

    #And I follow "Test assignment1"

    And I follow "Not Submitted"
   When I follow "Add submission"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Online text | I'm the student submission |
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I follow "Submit assignment"
    And I press "Continue"
    And I log out
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I open the personal menu
    And I wait until "#snap-personal-menu-grading[data-content-loaded=\"1\"]" "css_element" is visible
    # The above waits until the snap personal menu column is loaded.
   Then I should see "1 of 1 Submitted, 1 Ungraded"
    And I grade the assignment "Test assignment1" in course "C1" as follows:
      | username | grade | feedback                 |
      | student1 | 50    | I'm the teacher feedback |
    And I close the personal menu
    And I open the personal menu
    And I wait until "#snap-personal-menu-grading[data-content-loaded=\"1\"]" "css_element" is visible
    # The above waits until the snap personal menu column is loaded.
   Then I should see "You have no submissions to grade."
    And I follow "Log out"
    And I log in as "student1"
    And I open the personal menu
    And I should see "Test assignment1" in the "#snap-personal-menu-graded" "css_element"
    And I should see "Feedback"
