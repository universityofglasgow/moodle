*  Keyboard Input  *
********************

Keyboard Input is an HTML5 component providing a graphical interface that is
meant to be used in the context of interacting with a piano keyboard.

It takes as input an XML string describing the initial state of the keyboard,
along with a callback function that is called when the user changes the state
(e.g. by selecting/unselecting a note on the keyboard). On callback, the updated
keyboard state is passed back as an XML string.

A description of basic use is provided in the following documentation file:

[Keyboard Input component directory]/docs/modules/KeyboardInput.html.

DEPENDENCIES

This component is dependent on the YUI Javascript Library
(http://yuilibrary.com/ - It was developed and tested with YUI version 3.13).

In particular, it requires access within its scope to a Y object with the
following modules loaded:

base
node
datatype

This repository does not currently contain the required YUI modules, and so
the component above will not run "out of the box".

One good way to use this component with YUI is to package it as a YUI module.
To see an example of how this can be done, refer to
https://github.com/brissone/moodle-qtype_musictheory, where the component is
packaged as a YUI module within Moodle.
