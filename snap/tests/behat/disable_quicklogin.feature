Feature: Disable Snap quick login
  In order to use some advanced authentication functionality
  As an Admin
  I need to be able to disable the Snap quick login

  @javascript
  Scenario: Snap quick login is disabled
    Given the following config values are set as admin:
      | theme_snap_disablequicklogin | 1 |
    And I am on homepage
    And I wait until the page is ready
    Then ".btn.btn-default.snap-login-button.js-snap-pm-trigger" "css_element" should not exist
