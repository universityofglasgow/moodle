/**
 * Addon class.
 *
 * Deferred activation of the plugin is supported, but there are some caveats to
 * this feature which should be understand. Firstly, this class does not define
 * whether the addon is activated or not. The block is applying the logic that
 * will load local_xp\local\container or not. If the local_xp container is not
 * loaded, then this addon class will never be used.
 *
 * When our container is loaded, then this class will be used and basic checks
 * such as is_activated will return a positive value. Again, this class does not
 * activate the plugin, this class gets activated when the plugin is activated.
 *
 * Moreover, while we can use the container to decide whether or not local_xp
 * is "active" we cannot prevent Moodle from running the plugin's installation,
 * detecting its files (through hooks) etc. nor should we! As the plugin activation
 * can happen at a random time, we should let as much as possible of the normal
 * installation flow take place.
 *
 * However, some systems (shortcodes, mobile, tasks, event observers, ...) bypass
 * the container and thus can be triggered even if the plugin is not "activated".
 * In those cases, local_xp must on its own check whether it has been activated
 * by checking the di::get('addon')->is_activated() response. When it has not been
 * activated, it should either gracefully quit, or trigger an exception.
 *
 * For example, when the plugin is triggered during an event processing, or
 * in a shortcode, we should not abruptly crash if the plugin is not activated
 * and therefore should gracefully handle the process. However, for webservices
 * or the mobile app, we could more agressively trigger an exception as the
 * feature is not meant to be used.
 *
 * Note that when the plugin is not activated, a call to a locally defined
 * dependency (only defined in local_xp\local\container) would throw an exception
 * as the fallback from block_xp would be unaware of said object. One more reason
 * to ensure that the logic bypassing DI is handled.
