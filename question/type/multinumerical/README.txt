This question type allows asking questions such as :

Please enter X, Z, Z, such as :

    X + Y + Z > 12
    X - Y <= 3
    Z = [0;100] (Z is between 0 and 100, included)

For each constraint, a feedback can be generated, displaying some text for a condition being fulfilled, and some other text if not.

The grading can be set to be one of the following :

    100% (all constraints fulfilled) or 0%
    grade = (amount of constraints fulfilled) / (total amount of constraints)
