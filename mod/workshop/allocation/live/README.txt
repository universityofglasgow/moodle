Live allocation method for Moodle Workshop
==========================================

Allocation method for Moodle Workshop that automatically allocates for review
submissions made during the assessment phase.

activity. Submissions are immediately allocated to reviewers, this way students
do not have to wait until a teacher allocates the new submissions.

1. Enable "Late submissions" in the workshop settings.
2. Go to "Submission allocation" and enable "Live Allocation".
3. Switch to the "Assessment phase".
