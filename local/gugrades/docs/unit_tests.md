# UNIT TESTS

Unit tests are provided for testing the PHP side of the plugin. This primarily means
testing the web services expored by the plugin.

## Configuring Unit Tests

Please see document https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/phpunit

Currently tests can be run individually, using (for example)

    vendor/bin/phpunit local/gugrades/tests/external/get_add_grade_form_test.php

...or the complete set for the plugin can be executed using

    vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite local_gugrades_testsuite

## Test configuration

Web service tests, extend the class *gugrades_base_testcase*, *gugrades_advanced_testcase* and *gugrades_advanced_testcase*. T
his creates some basic structure for tests to use. Including...

* A course
* The 22-point scale
* A teacher
* Some students
* Grade categories (confirming to MyGrades requirements)
* Assignments
* Some grades for the Assignments
* gugrades_aggregation_testcase has functionality to load schemas and data from pre-prepared json files

## Test descriptions

### aggregation_schema2_test

Tests aggregation functionality. Tests above or below 75% completion and the basic aggregation strategies with scales.

* Test no data in aggregation
* Test output where completion < 75%
* test output where completion > 75%
* Test simple weighted mean result
* Test mode result
* Test median result
* Test max result
* Test min result


# aggregation_schema3_test

Test exception when all weights are zero in aggregation

* Test all weights being zero for mean aggregation (not an error) and weighted mean (an error)


# aggregation_schema5_test

Test aggregation strategies with points

* Test weighted mean
* Test simple weighted mean
* Test mode
* Test median
* Test max
* Test min


# aggregation_schema6_test

Test grade category 'drop lowest' functionality with points grades

* Test weighted mean with drop lowest selected
* Test weighted mean with drop lowest exceeding number of items


# aggregation_schema7_test

Test drop lowest functionality with scale grades. Test combinations of admin grades

* Test weighted mean with drop lowest selected
* Test weighted mean with drop lowest exceeding number of items
* Test NS grades at 2nd level+
* Test MV/IS grades at 2nd level+

# aggregation_schema8_test

More combination of admin grades tests


# aggregation_schema9_test

Performance testing of aggregation in very large datasets.

* Ongoing

# aggregation_strategies_test

More tests for aggregation strategies
