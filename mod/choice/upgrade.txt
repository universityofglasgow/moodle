This files describes API changes in /mod/choice/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.2 ===

* Events mod_choice\event\answer_submitted and mod_choice\event\answer_updated
  are no longer triggered. Observers listening to these events must instead listen
  to mod_choice\event\answer_created and mod_choice\event\answer_deleted that are
  triggered for each option that is selected or unselected. User whose choice was
  modified can be found in $event->relateduserid (this does not have to be the
  user who performs the action).

=== 3.0 ===

* External function mod_choice_external::get_choices_by_courses returned parameter "name" and
  mod_choice_external::get_choice_results "text" have been changed to PARAM_RAW.
  This is because the new external_format_string function may return raw data if the global moodlewssettingraw parameter is used.

=== 2.9 ===

* custom renderers must be updated to include action=makechoice field in display_options()
