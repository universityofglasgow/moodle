Gapfill question type V1.977 for Moodle 

A very easy to use Cloze question type that supports drag/drop answers that work on mobile devices and the mobile app. 
Teachers can define the question with square braces to define the missing words. For example The [cat] sat on the [mat]. 
Alternative delimiting characters can be defined during question edit for example The #cat# sat on the #mat# can be valid.

If the dropdown or dragdrop options are set in the question edit form, it can display a shuffled selection  of correct and 
wrong answers. These can then can be selected via dropddropdown lists or javascript powered drag and drop functionality.
