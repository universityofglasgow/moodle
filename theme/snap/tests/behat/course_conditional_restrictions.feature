Feature: When the moodle theme is set to Snap, conditional restrictions work as normal.

      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        | 1         | 1                |
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity | course | idnumber | name                        | intro                     | section | assignsubmission_onlinetext_enabled |
      | assign   | C1     | assign1  | S1 Restricted - date past   | Restricted by date past   | 1       | 1                                   |
      | assign   | C1     | assign2  | S1 Restricted - date future | Restricted by date future | 1       | 1                                   |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Conditionally restricted section notices show for students only when restrictions not met but always show for teachers.
  Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
    And I go to course section 1
    And I restrict course asset "S1 Restricted - date past" by date to "yesterday"
    And I restrict course asset "S1 Restricted - date future" by date to "tomorrow"
    And I should see available from date of "yesterday" in the 1st asset within section 1
    And I should see available from date of "tomorrow" in the 2nd asset within section 1
    And I go to course section 2
    And I restrict course asset "S2 Restricted - date past" by date to "yesterday"
    And I restrict course asset "S2 Restricted - date future" by date to "tomorrow"
    And I should see available from date of "yesterday" in the 1st asset within section 2
    And I should see available from date of "tomorrow" in the 2nd asset within section 2
    And I restrict course section 1 by date to "yesterday"
    And I restrict course section 2 by date to "tomorrow"
    And I should see "Conditional" in TOC item 1
    And I should see "Conditional" in TOC item 2
    And I should not see "Conditional" in TOC item 3
    And I go to course section 1
    And I should see available from date of "yesterday" in section 1
    And I go to course section 2
    And I should see available from date of "tomorrow" in section 2
    And I log out
    And I log in as "student1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
    And I should not see "Conditional" in TOC item 1
    And I should see "Conditional" in TOC item 2
    And I should not see "Conditional" in TOC item 3
    And I go to course section 1
    And I should not see available from date of "yesterday" in section 1
    And I should see available from date of "tomorrow" in the 2nd asset within section 1
    And I go to course section 2
    And I should see available from date of "tomorrow" in section 2
    And "#section-2 li.snap-activity" "css_element" should not exist
