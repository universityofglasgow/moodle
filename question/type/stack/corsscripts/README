These JavaScript libraries are to be loaded directly to IFRAMES and do not go through
the full module logic of the VLE.

Do not mix these with the AMD ones that the VLEs play with and always consider whether
it would be possible to do whatever you want to do with these.

Do note that default Moodle server configs do not provide headers suitable for loading
these into fully sandboxed IFRAMEs. This is why we have an extra script that serves
these out with a particular header.
