Version 1.8 of the Moodle Gapfill question type contributed by Marcus Green
Fixed a bug by adding checking for initialisation of array values. Discussed here
https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=314487#p1274939. Thanks to Ellen Spertus, 
Al Rachels and others for the feedback on this.

Added a value in settings so the default for case sensitive can be set
Updated the export of xml code so it adds information on the version of the Gapfill
plugin and the version of Moodle that ran the export. This data can be useful
for tracking down issues (it means I don't have to get back to people asking for
 versions which people may not know and might get wrong).

The | symbol will now be recognised as an or operator even
when regular expression processing is turned off. This is handy for programming language
and math questions that use characters treated as special such as \/?* etc.
