A very easy to use "select the words" Moodle question type. The question creator enters text
and puts square braces around the correct ones. So if the objective was to select the verb, the phrase
"The cat [sat] on the mat" would have square braces around sat. The user/student can select any word
and on submission the question can indicate which select was correct or incorrect. Read more about
