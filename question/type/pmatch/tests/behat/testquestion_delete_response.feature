      | teacher  | Teacher   |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user    | course | role           |
      | teacher | C1     | editingteacher |
    And the following "question categories" exist:

  Scenario: Delete an existing test response for a pattern match question.
    Given I am on the pattern match test responses page for question "My first pattern match question"
    # Check responses are listed correctly
    Given I should see "testing one two three four" in the "#qtype-pmatch-testquestion_r0_c5" "css_element"
    When I set the field with xpath "//form[@id='attemptsform']//table[@id='responses']//td[@id='qtype-pmatch-testquestion_r0_c0']//input" to "1"
    And I press "Delete"
    #The step When I click on "Yes" "button" confirming the dialogue doesn't find a dialogue so we use the following step instead.
    When  I click on "//div[contains(@class, 'moodle-dialogue-confirm')]//div[contains(@class, 'confirmation-dialogue')]//div[contains(@class, 'confirmation-buttons')]//input[contains(@value, 'Yes')]" "xpath_element"
    Then I should see "Pattern-match question testing tool: Testing question: My first pattern match question"
    And I should see "The responses were successfully deleted."

    # Confirm the response has been deleted
    When I press "Continue"
    Then I should see "Sample responses: 12"
    And I should see "Marked correctly: 0 (0%)"
    And I should see "Computed mark greater than human mark: 0 (missed positive)"
    And I should see "Computed mark less than human mark: 0 (missed negative)"
    # Confirm the computer mark
    And I should see "0" in the "#qtype-pmatch-testquestion_r0_c4" "css_element"
    # Confirm the response
    And I should see "testing" in the "#qtype-pmatch-testquestion_r0_c5" "css_element"
