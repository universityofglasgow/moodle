Steps to generate the minified file in case we have local modifications and we can't used the minified
file generated by https://github.com/bitovi/syn. Hopefully a solution for https://github.com/bitovi/syn/issues/30 will
be merged upstream and we can get rid of these modifications and this README.md

Steps to generate the minified version of syn.js
================================================

* Checkout the project with our local modifications
* cd to the directory
* npm install
* grunt build
* The resulting minified file will be stored in dist/syn.min.js
