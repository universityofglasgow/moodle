Adding answer tests to STACK

Changelog: Version 1st February 2020 - Chris Sangwin

****************************

From this point we only want answer tests which are part of Maxima.
This will enable us to migrate the whole PRT as a single Maxima call.

Unit testing a new Answertest
---------------------------------
Tests must be included.  These are added into /tests/fixtures/answertestsfixtures.class.php
