The "Elegance" Moodle Theme
======================

The idea of this theme, as usual with my themes, is to make the site look as little like Moodle as possible. Based on the original theme design by Aaron Marr at Falmouth University Iâ€™ve created a clean and minimal theme built on Bootstrap3 with many options to allow users to customise the theme to meet their branding needs without changing code.

Cool things to know about the theme.
 - It's not dead yet.
