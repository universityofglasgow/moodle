Feature: Configuring the behavior of the onlinesurvey block
  In order to adapt the presentation of our EvaSys online surveys in Moodle
  As admin
  I want to configure the behavior of the block_onlinesurvey plugin in multiple aspects

# This behat test feature file is fully working.
# But it needs a working EvaSys backend with surveys and users set up in a way as this test expects them as well.
# Because of that, the feature file is currently only shipped as disabled skeleton.
