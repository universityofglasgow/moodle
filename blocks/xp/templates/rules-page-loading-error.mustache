    @template block_xp/rules-page-loading-error

    Error to display when the rules page loads with errors.

    Note that we did not translate these strings, and we applied only inline styling
    because a) this should occur rarely enough that translations do not matter, b)
    styling can be broken when the page fails to load, so enforcing them is best.

    Lastly, we do not use the #js helper because the JavaScript needs to execute as
    this renders and not on page load, so it must be inlined. The JavaScript will
    check whether another expected part of the page was rendered (given a delay),
    and if not it will display this error.

    Example context (json):
    {
    }
}}
