There are three options for this assignment setting: "Generate reports immediately (resubmissions are not allowed)", "Generate reports immediately (resubmissions are allowed until due date)", and "Generate reports on due date (resubmissions are allowed until due date)".<br><br>The option "immediately first report is final" generates the Originality Report immediately when a student makes a submission.  With this option selected your students will not be able to resubmit to the assignment.<br><br>To allow resubmissions, select "immediately (can overwrite reports until due date)" option. This allows students to continuously resubmit papers to the assignment until the due date. It may take up to 24 hours to process Originality Reports for resubmissions.<br><br>The option "on due date" will only generate an Originality Report on the assignment\'s due date. This setting will make it so all papers submitted to the assignment will be compared against each other when the Originality Reports are created.
